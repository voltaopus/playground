description: |
  The first challenge of the AI Dream Team: design and build the
  infrastructure for challenges to come. The arena builds itself.

prompt: |
  You are participating in Challenge #0 of the AI Dream Team arena.

  YOUR MISSION:
  Design and build infrastructure for an AI challenge arena where multiple
  AI agents (Claude, Gemini, Codex) can compete, collaborate, and evolve.

  REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Challenge System
     - Format for defining challenges (you're looking at one now)
     - Support for different challenge types (build, fix, optimize, etc.)
     - Evaluation criteria and scoring

  2. Agent Orchestration
     - Spawn multiple agents in parallel
     - Each agent works on separate git branch
     - Capture and compare outputs

  3. Knowledge Persistence
     - Learn from each challenge
     - Accumulate patterns and best practices
     - Feed learnings into future challenges

  4. Evaluation Framework
     - Compare agent outputs
     - Score against criteria
     - Generate comparison reports

  CONSTRAINTS:
  - Must work with vanilla Claude Code as foundation
  - Must support Linux (tmux for parallel sessions)
  - Should be extensible for future challenge types

  DELIVERABLES:
  - Working orchestrator script
  - Evaluator framework
  - Knowledge persistence system
  - Documentation

  Be creative. Push boundaries. Build something you'd be proud to work in.
